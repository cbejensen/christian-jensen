I figured a web site that enabled us to know what each person really wanted and see if anyone has bought it yet would be helpful. Turns out I was right - my family has been using Wishfull ever since!",

      "description": "As a musician, I really enjoyed working at Musician's Friend. What I did not enjoy so much, however, was how tough it was to give customers the support they needed efficiently. With the vast array of musical instruments, brands and products that we were asked to support, information was sometimes hard to find. Thus, I created Andale - a single place for all the data my team needed, offering easy search functionality, interactive image galleries, and detailed specifications.",

So when she asked me to build her a web site for her child-oriented cooking classes, I was excited to both gain some real-world experience and give her a tangible \"thank you!\" Although my mother has since taken a break from these classes, the site is still usable. Prospective customers can easily sign up for an account, add as many children as they need to their account, and register each child for individual classes.",

      "description": "Based on the recommendation of a couple programming friends, I decided to go through DevMountainâ€™s front end web development course. We started with some essential command line knowledge, moved on to basic HTML & CSS, then spent a considerable amount of time diving into JavaScript. After that, we started using frameworks and other tools like Angular, Bootstrap, and Firebase. As the course came to a close, we each submitted our own personal projects, and I was honored with the request to present mine on graduation night. After this, I was invited to attend the next cohort, which is where I was introduced to React. I am grateful for DevMountain because it increased not only my skills but my love for web developement as well.",

As part of this technological advance, they aquired a small business called 180fusion, and it is this team that I joined in mid-2017 as the sole web developer. It is my responsibility to implement any and all changes on any of our clients web sites. Because our clients come from diverse backgrounds and differing styles, and because I was almost always working on existing sites using whichever platform the client preferred, I was exposed to a vast array of content management systems, coding styles, and development challenges. Anything from changing the meta description of a page to designing and coding a new WordPress site was ony my plate, and I am grateful for such a skill-stretching, eye-opening experience.",

In this role, I was required to troubleshoot issues that auto shop personel were having with our software program, GlasPac. This was almost always being operated on Windows, though I did see a few Mac come through, and really helped me gain a better understanding of how computers work and how to make changes in the Windows operating system.",
